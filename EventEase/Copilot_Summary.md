# Copilot Assistance Summary

This project was developed with assistance from Microsoft Copilot to accelerate Blazor development tasks and improve code quality:

- Generated the initial Blazor WebAssembly app scaffold and default pages.
- Created the `EventCard` component with two-way data binding for the event fields.
- Implemented routing for `Events`, `Registration`, and `Attendance` pages.
- Added validation using `EditForm` and `DataAnnotations` to ensure input quality.
- Implemented scoped `SessionState` service to manage events and user registrations.
- Built an Attendance Tracker that toggles presence and aggregates counts.
- Introduced `ErrorBoundary` to handle rendering errors gracefully.

Copilot helped draft component structures, services, and page wiring while I refined the logic, ensured parameter binding correctness, and aligned with Blazor idioms for state and validation. Continuous verification and adjustments were applied to ensure compliance with the assignment requirements.
